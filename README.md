About:

This product was created for Software Engineering I for professor Adrian Rusu. It is
programmed to be used on the web and is coded in HTML, CSS, and PHP. This program also uses
a MySQL database to store basic customer information such as their address and subscriptions.
It is intended for users of the program to be able to access this software system from the web and
from any computer. 

Specifications:

This system is intended to manage the delivery of newspapers and magazines in some
small town or area of a larger town. It is intended for use by newsagents who are only
casual users of computer systems and should run on a PC or similar hardware. Factors
which should be taken into account in specifying and designing this system are:

-For each delivery person, the system must print, each day, the publications to be
delivered to each address.
-The system should also print, for the newsagent, a summary of who received what
publications each day.
-Once a month, bills are delivered to customers along with their newspapers. These bills
should be computed automatically by the system.
-Customers come and go and may be away temporarily on holiday or on business.
-Not all customers necessarily have a delivery every day.
-The system should be able to manage some simple geographic information so that it
prints information for the delivery person in the order in which publications are delivered.
